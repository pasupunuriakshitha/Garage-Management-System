Fields When we talk about Salesforce, Fields represent the data stored in the columns of a relational database. It can also hold any valuable information that you require for a specific object. Hence, the overall searching, deletion, and editing of the records become simpler and quicker. Types of Fields

    Standard Fields
    Custom Fields Standard Fields: As the name suggests, the Standard Fields are the predefined fields in Salesforce that perform a standard task. The main point is that you can’t simply delete a Standard Field until it is a non-required standard field. Otherwise, users have the option to delete them at any point from the application freely. Moreover, we have some fields that you will find common in every Salesforce application. They are, ● Created By ● Owner ● Last Modified ● Field Made During object Creation Custom Fields: On the other side of the coin, Custom Fields are highly flexible, and users can change them according to requirements. Moreover, each organizer or company can use them if necessary. It means you need not always include them in the records, unlike Standard fields. Hence, the final decision depends on the user, and he can add/remove Custom Fields of any given form. Creation of fields for the Customer Details object

You can define profiles by the user's job function. For example, System Administrator, Developer, Sales Representative. Types of profiles in salesforce

    Standard profiles: By default, Salesforce provides below-standard profiles. ● Contract Manager ● Read Only ● Marketing User ● Solutions Manager ● Standard User ● System Administrator. We cannot delete standard ones Each of these standard ones includes a default set of permissions for all of the standard objects available on the platform.
    Custom Profiles: Custom ones defined by us. They can be deleted if there are no users assigned to that particular one.

Roles may be used to specify the types of access that people in your Salesforce organization can have to data. Simply put, it describes what a user could see within the Salesforce organization. Creating Manager Role Creating another roles Users A user is anyone who logs in to Salesforce. Users are employees at your company, such as sales reps, managers, and IT specialists, who need access to the company's records. Every user in Salesforce has a user account.

By creating and using public groups effectively, you can maintain a secure and organized Salesforce environment while ensuring that users have appropriate access to the resources they need. Creating New Public Group Sharing Setting Salesforce allows you to configure sharing settings to control how records are accessed and shared within your organization. These settings are crucial for maintaining data security and privacy. Salesforce provides a mixture of tools and mechanisms to define and enforce sharing rules, such as: arrangement-Wide Default (OWD) Settings: These settings define the default level of access for all objects within your Salesforce org. OWD settings include Private, Public Read-Only, Public Read/Write, and Controlled by Parent. OWD settings can be configured for each standard and custom object. Role Hierarchy: Salesforce uses a role hierarchy to determine record access. Users at higher levels in the hierarchy have greater access to records owned by or shared with users lower in the hierarchy. The role hierarchy is often used in combining with OWD settings to grant different levels of access. Profiles and Permission Sets: Profiles and permission sets allow executives to specify object-level and field-level permissions for users. Profiles are typically used to grant general object and field access, while permission sets can be used to extend those permissions to specific users. Sharing Rules: Sharing rules are used to extend access to records for users who meet specific standards. They can be used to grant read-only or read-write access to records owned by other users. Manual Sharing: executive and record owners can manually share specific records with other users or groups. Creating Sharing settings Create a Flow
